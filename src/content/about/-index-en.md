Dig DAO is a community for research and development of web3, which was born out of the Digital Agency's Web3.0 Study Group.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to discuss, research, practice, and disclose the ecosystem of Web 3.0 and the environment that should be maintained in order to be used for the healthy development of society.

## Activities

Discord is our primary activity and we also have Github. https://github.com/Dig-DAO

Members can start or join projects. Right now, the following projects are active.

### DID/VC SBT Project

### Supporting digital public goods

- Create digital public goods: Support the creation of new public goods to enrich the digital society.
- Increase the number of contributors: Create an environment in which contributors to digital public goods receive appropriate rewards and recognition.
- Create an appropriate method of allocating digital public good investments: Create a system in which those who support digital public goods participate in decision-making on investment allocation, so that public goods that provide higher value to society receive a larger share of the investment.
